# Genkit Amazon Bedrock Plugin

Amazon Bedrock plugin for Genkit Python. Provides text generation with
Bedrock-hosted models (Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, Meta Llama, Mistral,
Cohere, and others) through the Bedrock Converse and ConverseStream APIs, and
embeddings, image generation, and reranking through InvokeModel.

> Status: text generation (streaming and non-streaming), embedders, image
> generation, and reranking are available, which covers every surface of the
> mature Go plugin
> ([genkit-ai/aws-bedrock-go-plugin](https://github.com/genkit-ai/aws-bedrock-go-plugin)).
> The work left is sample app and docsite coverage, not plugin surfaces.

## Installation

```bash
pip install genkit-amazon-bedrock
```

## Usage

```python
from genkit import Genkit
from genkit_amazon_bedrock import Bedrock, ModelDefinition

ai = Genkit(
    plugins=[
        Bedrock(
            region='us-east-1',
            models=[ModelDefinition(name='anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0')],
        )
    ],
    model='bedrock/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0',
)
```

Credentials resolve through the standard AWS SDK chain (environment,
`~/.aws/credentials`, instance metadata). Pass a pre-configured
`boto3.session.Session` via `session=` for custom wiring. The region comes
from `region=` or the SDK chain (`AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`,
`~/.aws/config`); there is deliberately no default region.

## Embedders

Embedding models are listed separately from chat models, by bare model ID:

```python
from genkit import Genkit
from genkit_amazon_bedrock import Bedrock

ai = Genkit(plugins=[Bedrock(embedders=['amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0'])])

embeddings = await ai.embed(
    embedder='bedrock/amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0',
    content='Bedrock hosts models from several providers.',
)
```

| Model                                      | Dimensions | Modalities   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`               | 1536       | text         |
| `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`             | 1024       | text         |
| `amazon.titan-embed-image-v1`              | 1024       | text, image  |
| `cohere.embed-english-v3`                  | 1024       | text         |
| `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3`             | 1024       | text         |
| `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0` | 3072       | text         |

Notes:

- As with models, listing is optional: any routable embedding model ID
  resolves on demand, including inference-profile and ARN forms. Listing one
  only adds it to the Dev UI.
- `amazon.titan-embed-image-v1` is the only image embedder here. It accepts
  JPEG and PNG, one image per document, and averages the two vectors when a
  document carries text as well.
- **Cohere embedding is text-only on Bedrock.** The AWS parameters page
  documents an `images` field for Embed v3, but `aws bedrock
  get-foundation-model` reports `inputModalities: [TEXT]` for both v3 model IDs
  and a live image request is refused. A document with no text is rejected
  rather than sent; a media part alongside text is ignored.
- `cohere.embed-v4` is not supported yet -- it uses a different request schema and fails with `UNIMPLEMENTED`. It is also where Cohere image embedding will arrive.
- Per-request options are not honoured yet. Cohere requests are pinned to
  `input_type: search_document`, so these embedders are for indexing
  documents, not for embedding queries.
- `amazon.nova-2-multimodal-embeddings-v1:0` is offered in `us-east-1` only,
  and is text-only here; its image, audio, and video inputs are not ported.

### Config fields that are ignored

`BedrockConfig` inherits the core `ModelConfig` fields, so the Dev UI offers
`topK` and `version`. Converse has no equivalent parameters and both values
are dropped, matching the Go plugin. Models that support a top-k knob take it
through `additionalModelRequestFields` instead:

```python
BedrockConfig(additional_model_request_fields={'top_k': 40})
```

## Image generation

Image models go through InvokeModel rather than Converse, but they are ordinary
Genkit model actions: `ai.generate` returns the result as media parts carrying
data URLs. Declare one with `type='image'`:

```python
from genkit import Genkit
from genkit_amazon_bedrock import Bedrock, ModelDefinition

ai = Genkit(
    plugins=[
        Bedrock(
            # us-west-2: the active text-to-image models are offered there only.
            region='us-west-2',
            models=[ModelDefinition(name='stability.sd3-5-large-v1:0', type='image')],
        )
    ]
)

response = await ai.generate(
    model='bedrock/stability.sd3-5-large-v1:0',
    prompt='A tabby cat asleep on a sunlit windowsill, watercolour.',
)
image = response.media[0].url  # data:image/png;base64,...
```

Declaring is optional here too. An undeclared ID in one of the two families
below is classified as an image model on the spot, so a bare
`ai.generate(model='bedrock/<id>')` resolves and takes the InvokeModel path;
declaring adds the model to the Dev UI and pins the routing. The prompt is the
text of the most recent user message, concatenated across its text parts; other
parts are ignored, as these models are text-to-image only.

Streaming callbacks are never invoked for image models. There is nothing to
stream, so `generate_stream` yields no chunks and the images arrive on the
final response.

### Request shapes

The two families take incompatible bodies, so the request is built from the
model ID.

Amazon (IDs containing `titan-image` or `nova-canvas`) nests its options under
`imageGenerationConfig`, and that is the only config key read: any other
top-level key is dropped. Your entries are merged key by key over these
defaults:

```python
config={
    'imageGenerationConfig': {
        'numberOfImages': 1,
        'height': 1024,
        'width': 1024,
        'cfgScale': 8.0,
        'seed': 0,
        'quality': 'standard',  # Nova Canvas only, not sent for Titan Image
    }
}
```

Output is always `image/png`.

Stability (IDs containing `sd3-`, `stable-image-core`, or `stable-image-ultra`)
takes flat top-level fields, and the whole config dict is merged over the
defaults (`{'prompt': ..., 'output_format': 'png'}`), so `aspect_ratio`,
`seed`, `negative_prompt`, `output_format` and the rest all apply:

```python
config={'aspect_ratio': '16:9', 'output_format': 'jpeg', 'seed': 42}
```

The media part's MIME type follows `output_format`.

`BedrockImageConfig` is the exported config type for these calls. It declares
no fields and rejects nothing, on purpose: the two families take disjoint keys,
and `BedrockConfig` describes Converse parameters, so it would reject every
family-specific key here.

Genkit's generic generation options (`temperature`, `topP`, `maxOutputTokens`,
`apiKey`, and the rest of the common config) are not forwarded to image models,
since Bedrock's image APIs do not accept them.

### Availability

Verified against `aws bedrock get-foundation-model` on 2026-08-11:

| Model                               | Status                         | Regions                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `stability.sd3-5-large-v1:0`        | Active                         | `us-west-2`                                |
| `stability.stable-image-core-v1:1`  | Active                         | `us-west-2`                                |
| `stability.stable-image-ultra-v1:1` | Active                         | `us-west-2`                                |
| `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0`           | Legacy, end of life 2026-09-30 | `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-northeast-1` |

**The active text-to-image models are offered in `us-west-2` only.** Every image
model on offer in `us-east-1` is an editing service (inpaint, upscale, and the
rest), not text-to-image, so a text-to-image call needs `us-west-2`.

`amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` is the one Amazon option and it is Legacy, which is a
stronger restriction than the end-of-life date suggests: new accounts cannot
enable it at all, and an account that has enabled it loses access after 30 days
of disuse. Bedrock reports both as `ResourceNotFoundException`, which the plugin
surfaces verbatim, so a working integration can start failing without any change
on your side. Prefer a Stability model unless you specifically need Canvas.

Notes:

- Amazon Titan Image Generator (v1 and v2), Stable Diffusion XL, and the `v1:0`
  Stability SKUs (`sd3-large-v1:0`, `stable-image-core-v1:0`,
  `stable-image-ultra-v1:0`) are end of life on Bedrock and no longer callable.
- The `titan-image` family is still recognised, since it shares its request
  shape with Nova Canvas. The legacy Stable Diffusion XL schema
  (`text_prompts`/`artifacts`) is deliberately not ported.
- `amazon.nova-canvas-v1:0` has no `us.` cross-region inference profile, so
  those three regions are the whole of it.
- Stability's `stable-image-*` editing services (inpaint, erase object, search
  and replace, background removal, style guide, control sketch) are not
  text-to-image and are out of scope.
- Nova Canvas may return fewer images than `numberOfImages` asked for.
  Individually content-filtered images are dropped silently, and the plugin
  returns whatever arrived.

## Reranking

Reranking scores documents against a query, so a retrieval step can return its
hits in relevance order. It is a method on the plugin instance rather than a
Genkit action, so keep a reference to the `Bedrock` you pass to `Genkit`:

```python
from genkit import Document, Genkit
from genkit_amazon_bedrock import Bedrock, BedrockRerankOptions

bedrock = Bedrock(region='us-east-1')
ai = Genkit(plugins=[bedrock])

response = await bedrock.rerank(
    'cohere.rerank-v3-5:0',
    query='How do I configure authentication for Bedrock?',
    documents=[
        Document.from_text('Configure AWS credentials with environment variables or AWS SSO.'),
        Document.from_text('Nova Canvas returns generated images as base64-encoded PNG data.'),
        Document.from_text('Model access is granted per account and region in the Bedrock console.'),
    ],
    options=BedrockRerankOptions(top_n=2),
)

for document in response.documents:
    print(document.metadata.score, document.content[0].root.text)
```

Genkit Python has no reranker primitive: `ActionKind.RERANKER` exists as a bare
enum member, and the request and response types are not generated, so there is
nothing to register an action against. The Go plugin's `Rerank` is a standalone
function for the same reason. The types this plugin exports
(`BedrockRerankOptions`, `RankedDocumentData`, `RankedDocumentMetadata`,
`RerankerRequest`, `RerankerResponse`) mirror the schema types by the same
names.

Notes:

- `top_n` (`topN` when the options are passed as a dict) is clamped down to the
  number of documents sent, and `<= 0` or unset means all of them.
- Results arrive in the service's descending-relevance order and are neither
  re-sorted nor truncated client-side.
- A ranked document carries the input document's content verbatim and fresh
  `{score}` metadata. The input document's own metadata is not carried through.
- Rerank models have no Converse path, so they never resolve as chat models.
  Listing one in `models=` is ignored; pass the ID to `rerank()` instead.
- Only `bedrock:InvokeModel` is required. `bedrock:Rerank` is not: that
  permission belongs to the separate Bedrock Agent Runtime `Rerank` API, which
  this plugin does not call.

### Model support

Verified against `aws bedrock get-foundation-model` on 2026-08-11, and matching
AWS's [supported regions and models for reranking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank-supported.html):

| Model                  | Status | Regions                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cohere.rerank-v3-5:0` | Active | `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-northeast-1`, `ca-central-1` |
| `amazon.rerank-v1:0`   | Active | `us-west-2`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-northeast-1`, `ca-central-1`              |

**`amazon.rerank-v1:0` is not offered in `us-east-1`.** Only
`cohere.rerank-v3-5:0` covers every region on the list, so a setup that defaults
to `us-east-1` has one rerank model available, not two.

The two families take different bodies, so the request is built from the model
ID. Both send `query`, `documents` and `top_n`; only Cohere takes
`api_version`, whose schema requires the key, while the Amazon schema rejects
any body carrying it. An ID matching neither family gets the Cohere body, that
being the only shape AWS documents for InvokeModel reranking.

Any model ID is passed to InvokeModel verbatim, so inference profiles and ARNs
work too.
